PSEvolve is a graph-based genetic algorithm for molecular design. <br /> 
PSEvolve was applied for designing solvents with high lignin solubilities and lignocellulose processing [here](https://github.com/koenigmattern/PSEvolve_lignin_solvents).


main.py:
- main file for solvent design. 

utils.py:
- contains all functions of PSEvolve
